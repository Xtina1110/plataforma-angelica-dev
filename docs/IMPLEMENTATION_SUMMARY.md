## Overview

This document summarizes all the work completed on the Plataforma Angélica, including design system standardization and comprehensive blog improvements.

## Part 1: Design System Standardization

### Objective
Establish consistent border-radius values across the entire platform to create a cohesive, professional design language.

### Design System Created

A standardized scale for border-radius values was established and documented:

| Size | Value | Use Case | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Small** | `0.5rem` (8px) | Buttons, badges, inputs | Form fields, small buttons, progress bars |
| **Medium** | `0.75rem` (12px) | Cards, modals, panels | Audio cards, instruction cards, meta boxes |
| **Large** | `1rem` (16px) | Containers, sections | Main cards, content boxes, article cards |
| **XL** | `1.5rem` (24px) | Main containers, hero sections | Instruction boxes, main content areas |
| **Pill** | `9999px` | Tags, status indicators | Category badges, action buttons |
| **Circle** | `50%` | Avatars, icons | User avatars, icon containers |

### Files Updated

The following CSS files were audited and standardized:

1. **Sonoterapia.css** - 17 instances updated
2. **BlogPodcast.css** - 37 instances updated  
3. **TiradaAngelical.css** - Instruction container standardized
4. **CanalizacionesSonoterapia.css** - Already compliant

### Instruction Boxes Consistency

Ensured that instruction boxes in **Sonoterapia** and **Apertura Angelical** have identical dimensions:
- Border-radius: `1.5rem` (24px)
- Padding: `3rem 2rem`
- Box-shadow: Consistent depth and color

### Icon Updates

Replaced instruction icons in Sonoterapia with new custom designs:
- **Icono 2 (Intención Clara)**: Golden target with wings
- **Icono 3 (Receptividad Total)**: Hands with stars

### Results

The platform now has a unified, professional appearance with consistent rounded corners throughout all components. This improves visual coherence and enhances the user experience.
